# Steak with Mushroom Demi Glaze

This one requires a demi glaze to be truly great but you can make it without if you want


## Demi Glaze (cheater version)
- 4 quarts unsalted chicken stock
- 4 packages 

1. add stock to a large pot and sprinkle gelatin over the top
2. bring to a boil and reduce until about 1/4 of the stock remains
3. pour into tupperware and refrigerate after its set you can cut it into individual portions and freeze it or just scoop it from the tub and use as needed

## Steak with Mushroom Demi Glaze

- any kind of steak you like (skirt works great for this)
- mushrooms
- demiglaze you hopefully made
- red wine (optional)

1. season steak with salt pepper and garlic powder and cook to your liking (which is medium rare unless you're a faggot) remove and let rest
2. add thinly sliced mushrooms to pan and let cook till done
3. add a few tablespoons of your demiglaze and a slash of wine if you like (if you're lazy and didn't make the demiglaze just add a splash of stock or red wine and reduce until saucelike)
4. slice steak put on plate, top with mushroom sauce serve with mashed potatoes and roasted brussel sprouts (or whatever the fuck you want)
this is a great meal if you're trying to impress someone or just want a nice meal once in a while
