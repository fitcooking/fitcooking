# Protein "Pudding"

## Ingredients

- 1 package fat free cream cheese
- 3 scoops protein powder (ive only ever used chocolate but im sure any flavor would work)

- Honey (optional)
- Water/milk

## Directions

1. Bloom gelatin in 1/4 cup of COLD water then melt it in a pan or microwave
2. Mix cheese and protein powder until smooth and add melted gelatin and mix together
3. If needed slowly add milk/water until mixture is about the consistency of mayonnaise, if you want it sweeter feel free to add a little honey at this point.
4. Spoon/pipe into individual containers or just put the whole bowl in the fridge and let set overnight
5. spoon a little into a bowl with some fresh fruit
