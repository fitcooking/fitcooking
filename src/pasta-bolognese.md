# Pasta Bolognese

I don’t really measure just go by look/smell, and I recommend you try to figure out seasoning balances yourself to get better at cooking.

4-5 serves depending on your size


## Ingredients

- 1kg lean beef and/or pork, or turkey or chicken (I like beef for a rich/traditional meat sauce flavour, or turkey for a lighter more tomato-dominated sauce flavour)
- 1 packet of pasta (go for natty organic wholemeal for obvious reasons, or lentil/bean pasta if you want a little less carbs)
- 2 jars, or about 1.2-1.5 L of passata (peeled and strained tomato purée)
- 2 medium brown onions (or similar volume of eschallots instead if rich)
- 1/2 bulb garlic (non-Chinese)
- black pepper, good salt
- good olive oil (not blended, not refined)
- herbs. Use a lot: basil, oregano, parsley. Fresh is best, use more if fresh.
- recommended but optional herbs: marjoram, thyme, sage, cayenne pepper or chilli flakes (only small amounts of each, and you barely need any cayenne pepper if using that)
- optional extras: red bell peppers, mushrooms, bacon, celery (only a small amount if using any)
- toppings: scallions, hard Italian cheese (Parmesan/pecorino/grana padano)

## Directions

1. medium dice onion/eschallot
2. put into large pan, 4 tbsp oil, low heat (if using optional extras, add now and cook with the onions)
3. add a pinch of salt, stir occasionally, cook 10 minutes or until translucent but not browning
4. add crushed or minced garlic, a little of all the herbs, stir for a few minutes
5. push onions mixture to the side, add 1 tbsp oil to cover pan, turn heat to med-high
6. add ground meat(s), with some herbs on top, stir and break up any chucks, don’t let it stew, cook for a minute or two
7. stir onions and meat together and cook until meat is browned
8. add passata, a lot of pepper and about 1-2 tsp salt (not too much now, taste it later and add more if needed)
9. heat to high, bring to boil while stirring
10. heat to very low, simmer for an hour while stirring occasionally
11. boil large pot of water
12. when sauce close to ready, season to taste (salt/pepper)
13. add a lot of salt to pot of water, cook pasta to packet directions
14. drain pasta, stir pasta through sauce
15. put on plate, top with some scallions and grated cheese
16. enjoy. Good with red wine, bread, salad leaves. Or, put in containers if meal prep.
