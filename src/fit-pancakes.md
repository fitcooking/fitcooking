# Fit Pancakes

## Ingredients

- 1 egg
- 1/4 cup cottage cheese
- 1/4 sour cream or greek yoghurt
- 1/4 cup whole wheat flour
- 1 tbs flaxseed meal

Serves 1 person 

## Directions

Batter will be slightly too thick, add just a little milk to thin. I just eyeball this. 

Cook; will take longer than a normal pancake so be patient and do one at a time until you get the hang of it.

Serve with lots of butter, and fruit-only jam instead of syrup.
