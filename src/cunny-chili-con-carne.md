# Cunny Chili Con Carne

## Ingredients

- 500g mince beef (I use about 18%)
- 1 can of chopped tomatoes (400g)
- 1 can of red kidney beans
- Chili powder
- Cayene chili powder
- smoked paprika
- dried red chili
- salt
- pepper
- 1tsp of ground cumin
- 400ml of beef stock
- 1 high fibre pitta bread


## Instructions

1. Brown beef mince (can remove fat if you want)
2. now add some salt and pepper
3. now add your beef stock and tomatoes
4. now add the spices
5. simmer for 45 mins
6. add red kidney beans
7. wait for another 5 to 10 mins, still allow to simmer
8. serve and eat with pitta bread, I personally like to slice the bread and put it in my bowl and eat it.


## Macros

- 165g protein
- 52.88g carbs (without pitta bread)
- 55g of fat (assuming you didn't throw the fat away)
- calories in total = 1450

I didn't calculate things like spices, or the beef stock since they are p irrelevant. Also the pitta bread wasn't added in the calc.

Serves 3 meals
