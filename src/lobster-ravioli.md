# Lobster Ravioli

## Ingredients

- 1 Whole lobster
- One onion
- Two carrots
- Four sticks of celery
- Olive oil
- Tomato paste
- White wine
- Flour
- Bay leaves
- 2 large eggs
- 1 cup of cream

## Directions

### Lobster and Sauce

1. Boil 1 whole lobster
2. Remove all meat from shell and save the water you cooked it in, liver, roe and shell
3. Toss all the lobster discards back into the pot and reduce it down to a cup or two of lobster stock
4. Chop up one onion, two carrots, four sticks of celery into fine cubes
5. Fry in olive oil low heat for 8 minutes, then mix in 2tbsp of tomato paste 
6. Pour 1 cup of white wine in 
7. Add bay leaves
8. Reduce to half
9. Pour lobster stock in with a cup of cream 
10. Simmer 10m
11. Add salt/pepper/paprika to taste
12. Dilute some flour in cold water and pour that into the soup if its not thick enough, you want this thick like chowder
13. Take the bay leaves out before serving because eating a bay leaf can actually kill you


### Dough

1. 1tsp olive oil, 2 large eggs and a pinch of salt
2. Knead that shit 6-10 mins, until its no longer sticky
3. If it still sticks after 10m add a very small amount of flour and knead another 5m 
4. Roll that shit as flat as you can, thinner than the width of a coin if possible
5. Pasta dough is something you can't really overknead, unlike bread so dont worry about that

### Assembly

1. Mix your lobster meat with about 1 cup of ricotta, half a cup of shredded hard cheese like pecorino or parmasean (if using kraft style pre-shredded parm, use like 1/4 cup instead cause its fuckin salty)

2. Then you can choose a few flavor profiles to go with for the ravioli. Lemon pairs well with everything, lemon and mint does too but the mint can be overpowering of the lobster. You could sweat some finely chopped garlic in butter and throw that in for a more lobster-ey taste or the opposite, half a cup of (cooked) ground beef for a more hearty traditional ravioli flavor with just hints of lobster. But whatever you pick, mix that up with the cheese and lobster mixture.

3. Watch a youtube video on ravioli folding technique so you know how to shape the dough you're placing the mixture on, and how much to  use. A 30 second video would explain that part way better than what i can type up. 

4. Get all the ravioli made, then gently place it into a large pot of simmering water juuuuuuuuuuust below boiling point. The pasta are delicate and a rapid boil can rip them apart. In the water for 4 mins. 

5. Remove them with a slotted spoon, don't pour the whole thing into a strainer or it'll rip them all

6. Either plate them and pour the lobster bisque you made over them immediately, or you can drop them into the lobster bisque itself but they'll become soggy if you leave them in the boiling water, and they'll stick together and become one big mess if you take them out and let them sit dry, so plan what you're gonna do with them. 

7. Never freeze lobster or lobster ravioli, cooked or uncooked. Lobster has an enzyme in it that spoils it within hours. it must be cooked within 3 hours of being killed, and it must be eaten within 24 hours of being cooked. So tomorrows left overs is the most you can get away with.

Extra: 
People tend to fuck up their first few attempts at ravioli and have the pasta open up and rip in the pot, you might want to try making regular cheese or beef ravioli a few times, using all the same ingredients for the filling minus the lobster, to save yourself the heartache of doing all that extra work only to have a mess
