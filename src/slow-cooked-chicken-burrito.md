# Slow Cooked Chicken Burrito

## Ingredients

- 1/2-1 Onion
- 1-2 Bell Pepper
- 1 can black beans (15 oz)
- 1 tsp salt
- 1/2 tsp cumin
- 2.5 tsp chili powder
- 1/2 tsp cayenne
- 1/2 tsp pepper
- 1 can salsa (16 oz)
- 650g chicken breast
- 1.5 cups rice
- Tortillas
- Yogurt 
- Cheese 
- Lettuce if desired
I usually add a bit more of the spices but up to you

## Directions

1. Chop veg, drain beans, add to pot with salsa & spices and mix
2. Place chicken on top, set to low
3. Cook for 50 minutes, turning chicken halfway through
4. Shred chicken, add rice and set to high (for slow cooker only, I find it's better to do the rice separately on the stovetop)
5. assemble burrito as you like
