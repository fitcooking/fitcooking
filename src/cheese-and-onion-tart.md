# Cheese & Onion Tart

## Ingredients

- 1 Puff pastry roll
- 1 Onion
- Vinegar
- 300-400g Creme freche
- 30g Cheese
- 1 Tomato
- Mustard
- Mushrooms (optional)
- Pesto (Alternative instead of mustard)

## Directions

1. Get a whole puff pastry roll.
2. Roll it out and put it in the oven at 200c for 10 minutes.
3. Meanwhile; fry an onion(or half if you're a pussy) in some oil (protip for fried onions; cut onion and put in a bowl with 1 tbsp water, tsp vinegar and a pinch of salt and sugar, mix occasionaly for 5-10 minutes, this is to be done before frying them if you want that nice lightly-fried onion crunch without having it taste like absolute shit. A pinch is less than you think it is.) 
4. Once the onions are starting to go transclucent/soft/shrink up, take off the heat and add a tub of creme creche (a tub is more or less 300-400g) and at least 30g off cheese. Mix until melted. (You could also do mushrooms or whateveer the fuck you want instead of onions)
5. Cut your tomato into slices (or mix a 1-2 tbsp of tomato paste and some salt with water till it is just saucy) and lay on top of the pastry.
6. Then spread your cheesy onion mix all over and put in the oven for another ten minutes or until either the pastry is burning or the cheese sauce is dry-ish.
7. Drip the pesto over it BEFORE you put it in the oven.
8. For the mustard, mix equal parts vinegar and mustard to drip over it AFTER you take it out.
9. Do not use both pesto and mustard vinegar unless you are an abomination.
