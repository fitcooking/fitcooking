## Ingredients

- One large Onion, Diced
- 3 Bell Peppers, Diced
- 4 Cloves Garlic, Minced
- 1 Jalapeno, Diced
- 1/2 Bunch Cilantro, Chopped
- 2 cans chili tomatoes (preferably with jalapeno or habanero in them)

- 2 cans white beans (great northern or cannelini)
- 1 rotisserie chicken from the grocery store deli
- Cumin
- Chili Powder
- Corriander Powder

- 2 Limes

## Directions

1. Sweat the onions and peppers until soft, then add garlic and cook for one more minute
2. Add canned tomatoes
3. Add 1 and 1/2 can of beans
4. crush up the other half can of beans in the can and add in some of the chicken stock (this helps to thicken the chili a bit)
5. Add chicken stock and raise to a simmer
6. remove all meat from the chicken and rough chop it, add to chili
7. Put in salt, pepper, cumin, chili powder, and coriander to taste (I don't measure so I don't know how much)
