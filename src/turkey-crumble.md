# Turkey Crumble

Here's my turkey crumble that everyone says smells delicious and tastes great.


## Ingredients

- 450g/1lb ground turkey or chicken
- 100-150g onion
- 300-350g cauliflower
- half cup uncooked black rice
- turmeric/curry powder
- garlic
- salt/pepper
- olive oil

## Directions


1. Put rice in rice cooker with some broth. Turn it on.
2. Oil in pan, add minced garlic, then cook chopped onion until clear.
3. Brown the turkey.
4. Add chopped cauliflower.
5. Sprinkle on your salt/pepper and then add whatever spices you want. Turmeric and curry tastes delicious with this. Cumin would also work.
6. Rice should be done by now. Dump that in and stir.
7. Enjoy a fragrant, simple, healthy meal. I like to eat one serving for dinner and take the other serving for lunch the next day. Keeps well up to 5 days in the fridge.
